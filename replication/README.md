## How to Reproduce

All Monte Carlo simulations and figures are generated by R code chunks embedded in `ivb_paper_psrm.Rmd`. No external data files are required.

### Requirements

- **R** (>= 4.0)
- **R packages:** `rmarkdown`, `knitr`, `ggplot2`, `kableExtra`
- **LaTeX distribution** with `pdflatex` (e.g., TeX Live or TinyTeX)

### Install R packages

```r
install.packages(c("rmarkdown", "knitr", "ggplot2", "kableExtra"))
```

### Compile the paper

```r
rmarkdown::render("ivb_paper_psrm.Rmd")
```

This produces `ivb_paper_psrm.pdf` with all figures, tables, and appendices.

### Simulation details

The paper includes three Monte Carlo experiments (500 replications each), all defined and executed within the Rmd file:

1. **Cross-section DGP** (Section 5): Validates the IVB formula for a simple three-variable collider model.
2. **ADL DGP** (Section 5): Validates the IVB formula for an autoregressive distributed lag model.
3. **Civil war DGP** (Sections 5--6): Applies the IVB formula to a stylized political change--civil war model with Democracy Level as a collider.

Cached results are not included; all simulations run from scratch during compilation.
